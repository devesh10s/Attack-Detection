# Attack-Detection

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a powerful tool for analyzing attacker behavior and understanding the different tactics and techniques they use during an attack. The framework provides a standardized way to categorize and describe these tactics and techniques, making it easier for organizations to identify and respond to attacks. One of the key benefits of using the MITRE ATT&CK framework is that it provides a comprehensive view of the different stages of an attack.

This allows organizations to better understand the attack lifecycle and the different tactics and techniques attackers use at each stage. By understanding these tactics and techniques, organizations can develop more effective security controls and mitigation strategies to better defend against attacks.

Another important benefit of the MITRE ATT&CK framework is that it helps organizations develop better threat intelligence. By tracking the use of specific tactics and techniques across different attacks and campaigns, organizations can gain insights into the tactics and techniques favored by different threat actors. This can help organizations anticipate and respond to future attacks more effectively.

The following figure shows the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of the framework
